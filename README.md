# PyUDP
https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/UDP  
Basically grabs data about gacha/advent/whatever units in the game "The Battle Cats" (upgrade costs, TF requirements, talents, catcombos)  

**To-do list:**  
- Optimize the program: initializing a Unit object is currently pretty slow (using class properties did help a bit)  
- Add simple documentation: as of now, you can read the comments in src/PyUDP.py
- Add other stats
- Add catcombo object (more readable)?
- unrelated to this but stop procrastinating on learning Rust
